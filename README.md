# YouTube Timestamps

Repo to track the progress of adding time stamps to the Julia Language's YouTube videos.

## Get Involved

If you want to help add timestamps to the YouTube videos found here: https://www.youtube.com/user/julialanguage, please follow the below steps:

- See the time stamps in the description here: [DGojI9xcCfg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGojI9xcCfg&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q2Kr16aWPOKE0dz9OnsnIJ&index=2) for an example of what you should do. 
- Find a video without time stamps that interests you
- Watch the video and note the descriptive timestamps
- Open a new issue with the videos title to "claim" the video such that there's no overlapping work
- Add those timestamps to the issue you opened (see here for an example: https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/YouTubeVideoTimestamps/issues/84)

<!-- Replace last two from above with following to accept "Submissions via Files" -->
<!--
- Create a new markdown file in the `videos` folder name with the title of the video
- Add those timestamps to the markdown file you created above (see here for an example: https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/YouTubeVideoTimestamps/pull/165)
- In the "Propose changes" section at button, enter  `Add timestamps for "<NAME-OF-THE-VIDEO>"` (where NAME-OF-THE-VIDEO will be the actual title of the video) in the field below, and click "Propose changes"
-->

Once the timestamps are accepted, we will add a S/o to you in the video description as a thank you for your help!

Thank you! #JuliaLang
